HELLO, WORLD!
Thank you for participating in this project - your computer is now self-aware! You can use the enclosed "cascade" file with computer vision software to let your computer see itself and similar computers.

WHAT'S HERE?
This folder contains all the files used to generate your computer vision file, plus a few others:

0000-XXXXXX.xml: the actual computer vision file! (the number is your computer's ID, followed by its name)

Cascade Files: files created while training the computer vision file

Collection Files: a list of all the images taken of your computer

Saved Images: images taken of your computer, processed for computer vision training

Vector Files: a compressed, binary version of the images of your computer

This project was commissioned by Impakt.nl and produced during a residency in Utrecht, Netherlands in the summer of 2014. It was made possible with the support of the City of Utrecht and the Mondriaan Fund.
