Mirror Test
==========

A project teaching computers to recognize other computers, funded by a residency with [Impakt](http://www.impakt.nl).

*Note that this code is a work in progress and will likely remain a mess for while: apologies.*

####CONTENTS
* **Automated Training**  
Python script and other files for training OpenCV using lists of settings - useful for automating a variety of settings when you don't know exactly what will work best.
* **Book Files**  
Files for the print-on-demand book.
* **CAD Files**  
Various CAD files of ideas for taking images of computers from a variety of angles. 'Hot Shoe Mirror Bracket' was ultimately printed and used, the others are there for posterity.
* **Cascade Files**  
Final cascade files used in the book.
* **Create Collection File For OpenCV**  
A Processing app to select objects from a series of images, saving them into a "collection file".
* **Misc And Process Files**  
Screenshots, utility scripts, and other miscellany.
* **No Black Pixels**  
A processing app that loads an image and changes any fully-black pixels (0,0,0) to just slightly lighter (1,1,1) which allows black to be used as the background color in training.
* **Notes and Ideas**  
Working notes, thoughts, citations, etc.
* **Test Cascade**  
A Python app to load lots of cascade files and test them, applying ratings which are saved to a CSV file.
* **Training Instructions**  
A detailed set of instructions for training OpenCV; right now a WIP.
